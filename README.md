*DISCRIPTION*:I developed an interactive quiz app on geographical information using tools like "Visual Studio Code" for coding and editing. The app is built using *HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript, allowing a fully functional, dynamic experience. I also utilized "Quick.ref.me" for coding references and *ChatGPT* for resolving technical issues and enhancing coding practices. 

To improve my front-end development skills, I watched tutorials from "Apna College" on YouTube, focusing on HTML projects. These tutorials helped me understand the fundamentals of structuring web pages and styling them effectively.

The app is designed for geography quizzes but is highly adaptable. By simply editing the JavaScript code, users can replace geography questions with any other topic, such as general knowledge or history. The questions and answers are stored in an array, making it easy to modify. Additionally, the app tracks users' scores, providing feedback after each question and showing the final score at the end of the quiz.

The app is responsive, meaning it works well across devices, from desktops to mobile phones. Its modular structure allows further enhancements, such as adding timers or leaderboards. Overall, the app is a versatile, customizable tool suitable for educational quizzes in any subject.
